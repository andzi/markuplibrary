		<h3>Open Font Licence</h3>

		<h1>SIL Open Font License</h1>
		<h3 class="license-version"><small>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</small></h3>

		<h4>Preamble</h4>
		<p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
		development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
		efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
		open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
		with others.</p>

		<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
		redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
		fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
		redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
		names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
		however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
		requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
		to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

		<h4>Definitions</h4>

		Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
		include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
